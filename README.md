### Important Note:

This is my first public program written in C, so it may contain bugs. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to contact me through GitHub.

If you choose to download the program, first of all, thank you! Secondly, you may encounter a warning that it's a potential virus. This warning is triggered because the program has an undefined author. Rest assured, this will be resolved shortly.

### List of Known Bugs:

As of now, the application hasn't undergone thorough testing to compile a list of known bugs. However, this will be addressed soon! :)
